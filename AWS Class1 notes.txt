What is Cloud Computing?

It is the use of remote servers on the internet to store, manage and process 
data rather than a local server or personal computer.

--> Storing data/applications on remote servers 
--> Processing Data/applications from Servers 
--> Accessing data/applications through internet.

What is AWS?

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.

->The AWS service is provided by the Amazon that uses distributed IT infrastructure to provide different IT
resources available on demand. It provides different services such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS),
platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS).

->Amazon launched AWS, a cloud computing platform to allow the different organizations to take advantage
of reliable IT infrastructure.

USES OF AWS

->A small manufacturing organization uses their expertise to expand their business by leaving their IT
management to the AWS.

->A large enterprise spread across the globe can utilize the AWS to deliver the training to the distributed
workforce.

->An architecture consulting company can use AWS to get the high-compute rendering of construction
prototype.

-> A media company can use the AWS to provide different types of content such as ebox or audio files to the
worldwide files.

        
why aws become more powerful than any onther cloud services

-> AWS is the first cloud based service came before 7 years than anyother services .
-> AWS has many unique services
-> Pricing model -> Pay as u go 

Advantages

-> Cost effective
-> Flexibility
-> Scalability
-> Security

Different Domains that AWS offers :-

->Compute
It is used to process data on the cloud by making use of powerful processors which serve multiple instances
at a time.

->Storage and Content Delivery
The storage as the name suggests, is used to store data in the cloud, this data can be stored anywhere but
content delivery on the other hand is used to cache data nearer to the user so as to provide low latency.

->Database
The database domain is used to provide reliable relational and non-relational database instances managed
by AWS.

->Networking
It includes services which provide a variety of networking features such as security, faster access etc.

->Management Tools
It includes services which can be used to manage and monitor your AWS instances.

->Security and Identity
It includes services for user authentication or limiting access to a certain set of audience on your AWS
resources.

->Application Services
It includes simple services like notifications, emailing and queuing.


AWS Architecture

AWS Global Infrastructure

Regions:-

->AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. 
->We call each group of logical data centers an Availability Zone. 
->Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZs within a geographic area. 
->Unlike other cloud providers, who often define a region as a single data center, the multiple AZ design of every AWS Region offers advantages for customers. 
->Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected via redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. 
->AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even greater fault-tolerance. 
->AWS infrastructure Regions meet the highest levels of security, compliance, and data protection.
->AWS provides a more extensive global footprint than any other cloud provider, and to support its global footprint and ensure customers are served across the world,
->AWS opens new Regions rapidly. AWS maintains multiple geographic Regions, including Regions in North America, South America, Europe, China, Asia Pacific, South Africa, and the Middle East.

Availability Zone:-

->An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.
->AZs give customers the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. 
->All AZs in an AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber providing high-throughput, low-latency networking between AZs.
->All traffic between AZs is encrypted. 
->The network performance is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication between AZs.
->AZs make partitioning applications for high availability easy. 
->If an application is partitioned across AZs, companies are better isolated and protected from issues such as power outages, lightning strikes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and more. 
->AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance, many kilometers, from any other AZ, although all are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other.
